      Delete logstash indices older than 45 days (based on index name), for logstash-
      prefixed indices. Ignore the error if the filter does not result in an actionable

      forceMerge logstash- prefixed indices older than 2 days (based on index
      creation_date) to 2 segments per shard.  Delay 120 seconds between each
      forceMerge operation to allow the cluster to quiesce.
      This action will ignore indices already forceMerged to the same or fewer
      number of segments per shard, so the 'forcemerged' filter is unneeded.
